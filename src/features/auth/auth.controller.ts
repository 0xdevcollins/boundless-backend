// This file has been cleaned up as part of the migration to Better Auth.
// All legacy JWT-based authentication functions have been removed.
// Better Auth now handles all authentication endpoints at /api/auth/*
// User profile endpoints are handled by user.controller.ts and user.route.ts

// File intentionally left minimal after Better Auth migration
